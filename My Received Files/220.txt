[?2/?20/?2018 9:55 AM] Vo, Melissa: 
prism stop telling people to call
[?2/?20/?2018 10:08 AM] Mariano, Priscilla: 
Why
[?2/?20/?2018 10:09 AM] Mariano, Priscilla: 
Why shouldn’t I tell them to call??
[?2/?20/?2018 10:09 AM] Vo, Melissa: 
we are swamped right now
[?2/?20/?2018 10:11 AM] Mariano, Priscilla: 
Mel, are you going to call them
[?2/?20/?2018 10:11 AM] Vo, Melissa: 
are you going to answer the phone calls?
[?2/?20/?2018 10:24 AM] Mariano, Priscilla: 
Melissa you know that if we can’t resolve a ticket by text we ask the client to call. I’m not in today and tomorrow so unless you will call the people, they need to call to get help. 
I also spoke to Yan and she is okay with me me asking them to call. 
If there are calls on the queue already, they can wait in the queue and be attended to when it’s their turn
[?2/?20/?2018 10:27 AM] Vo, Melissa: 
yeah with a wait of 15 minutes
sure
we are fine now
thanks
[?2/?20/?2018 10:35 AM] Mariano, Priscilla: 
Yes with a wait of 15mins..  it happens when it’s busy
It won’t be the first time.. 
[?2/?20/?2018 10:37 AM] Vo, Melissa: 
k
I'm not trying to argue.
[?2/?20/?2018 10:39 AM] Vo, Melissa: 
yup. not going to argue.
[?2/?20/?2018 10:41 AM] Mariano, Priscilla: 
Yes it shouldn’t be an argument at all. It’s one thing to say can you hold off from telling people to call until we’re less overwhelmed, than to say stop... 
[?2/?20/?2018 10:42 AM] Vo, Melissa: 
I just feel like you're playing us.
[?2/?20/?2018 10:43 AM] Mariano, Priscilla: 
You worked at the helpdesk before and you know that when we can’t resolve a ticket through text or we need to connect remotely to further troubleshoot, we ask them to call. What’s so different about today?
[?2/?20/?2018 10:43 AM] Vo, Melissa: 
It's just Yanup there
*yan
and she's too nice to say something
[?2/?20/?2018 10:44 AM] Mariano, Priscilla: 
Anyone who gets the call resolves the issue, she knows that and you know that. So you’d rather have the queue get to 40 or so tickets and have Yan work on them alone? 
Yan can talk just fine, and if she can’t talk to me, she has Matt to talk to..
[?2/?20/?2018 10:47 AM] Mariano, Priscilla: 
Like I said, she and Ryan know that we ask people to call when we see it fit and whoever gets the call can assist. Did she complain to you that you had to speak for her?
[?2/?20/?2018 10:49 AM] Vo, Melissa: 
No. I'm just saying something cuz no one will.
i have to go ttyl
[?2/?20/?2018 10:50 AM] Mariano, Priscilla: 
Mel, it’s not your place to do that. 
You’re not my supervisor and you’re not her supervisor!
